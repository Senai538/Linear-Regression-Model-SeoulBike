# Linear-Regression-Model-SeoulBike


# Skills Used
Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Linear Regression, Sklearn, Seaborn

# Project Obective
In this project I build a linear regression model to predict the the number of bikes rented on a given day. This factor depends on the weather, visibility, etc.

# Quantifiable Results
I got a 79% accuracy.

We learn what variables affect the bikes the rented on a given day.
